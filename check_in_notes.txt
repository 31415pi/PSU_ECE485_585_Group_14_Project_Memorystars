Relaxed Consistency:
	Free to do things out of order...
	Reorder read s and reads and writes.
	
Something in queue, advance something by 1 clock tick at a time.
Nothing in queue - dont do it 1 at a time. 
Switch index to next thing in file...

only handle 1 request at a time...
super relaxed: only inserting 1 item per clock tick...
cur time == 100 ?
  is there something in file to happen, y / n --> read it and put in queue. 
  IS read entry >= simulated time / buffer not full... 

Parser / not intelligent. 
15/20 entries in while loop:
	current global simulation
	time of next event in file
	(error) previous event in file?
*SIMPLE* WHILE not done 0- what to do...  - main loop 
if its put in buffer then read the next one.
if not then deal with it and then move on.


next checkin is 2 weeks from last date...

quit when EOF & queue is empty.
